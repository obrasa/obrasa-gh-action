# Obrasa Tree Mutator GitHub Action

A GitHub Action that runs mutation testing on your codebase using the [Obrasa Tree Mutator](https://github.com/obrasa/tree-mutator). This action downloads the pre-built binary from releases and runs mutation testing based on your configuration.

## Features

- üöÄ **Easy Setup**: Just add the action to your workflow - no dependencies to install
- ‚ö° **Fast**: Uses pre-built binary, no compilation or dependency installation required
- üîß **Configurable**: Specify your own `obrasa.yaml` configuration file
- üìä **Rich Reports**: Generates HTML, JSON, and Markdown mutation reports
- üè∑Ô∏è **Version Control**: Pin to specific tree-mutator versions or use latest
- üìà **CI Integration**: Outputs mutation score for use in other workflow steps
- üîí **Private Repository Support**: Works with private tree-mutator repository
- üåê **Cross-Platform**: Supports Linux and macOS runners
- üß© **Modular**: Clean script-based architecture for easy maintenance

## Supported Languages

The tree-mutator supports mutation testing for:
- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Java
- C/C++
- Rust
- Go
- Ruby
- Lisp
- C#

## Configuration File

Create an `obrasa.yaml` file in your repository to configure the mutation testing:

```yaml
# obrasa.yaml
source: 
  - src
  - lib

test:
  command: pytest --tb=short
  timeout: 300

file_selection_strategy:
  type: random

mutations:
  - string_prefix
  - arithmetic_negation
  - boolean_operator
  - conditional_boundary

exclude:
  - "**/test_*"
  - "**/__pycache__/**"

output:
  directory: ./mutation-results
  report: ./mutation-report
  formats: [json, html, markdown]
```

### Configuration Options

- **source**: List of directories to scan for mutations
- **test**: Test command and timeout configuration
- **file_selection_strategy**: Strategy for selecting files to mutate (random, weighted, hotspot)
- **mutations**: List of mutation operators to apply
- **exclude**: Patterns to exclude from mutation
- **output**: Report generation configuration

## Examples

### Python Project

```yaml
# obrasa.yaml for Python project
source:
  - src

test:
  command: python -m pytest tests/ -v
  timeout: 600

file_selection_strategy:
  type: random

mutations:
  - string_prefix
  - arithmetic_negation
  - python_none_replacement

exclude:
  - "**/test_*.py"
  - "**/*_test.py"

output:
  directory: ./mutation-results
  report: ./mutation-report
  formats: [json, html]
```

### JavaScript/Node.js Project

```yaml
# obrasa.yaml for JavaScript project
source:
  - src
  - lib

test:
  command: npm test
  timeout: 300

file_selection_strategy:
  type: weighted

mutations:
  - string_prefix
  - increment_decrement_swap

exclude:
  - "**/*.test.js"
  - "**/*.spec.js"

output:
  directory: ./mutation-results
  report: ./mutation-report
  formats: [json, html, markdown]
```

## Binary Download

The action automatically detects your runner's platform and downloads the appropriate binary:

- **Linux x86_64**: `mutator-linux-amd64`
- **macOS x86_64**: `mutator-macos-amd64`
- **macOS ARM64**: `mutator-macos-arm64`

**Coming Soon**: Linux ARM64 support will be enabled when GitHub's native ARM64 runners become available for private repositories.

### Platform Detection and Fallbacks

The action uses intelligent platform detection:

1. **Native Architecture First**: Downloads the binary matching your exact platform and architecture
2. **Automatic Fallbacks**: If the native binary isn't available, falls back to compatible alternatives:
   - ARM64 systems can use x86_64 binaries (via emulation/Rosetta)
   - Provides clear messaging about which binary is being used

### Supported GitHub Runners

| Runner | Platform | Architecture | Binary Used | Build Method | Status |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| `ubuntu-latest` | Linux | x86_64 | `mutator-linux-amd64` | Native | ‚úÖ Available |
| `macos-13` | macOS | x86_64 | `mutator-macos-amd64` | Native | ‚úÖ Available |
| `macos-latest` | macOS | ARM64 | `mutator-macos-arm64` | Native | ‚úÖ Available |
| `macos-14` | macOS | ARM64 | `mutator-macos-arm64` | Native | ‚úÖ Available |
| `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | Linux | ARM64 | `mutator-linux-arm64` | Native | üöß Coming Soon* |
| `ubuntu-22.04-arm` | Linux | ARM64 | `mutator-linux-arm64` | Native | üöß Coming Soon* |

**\* Coming Soon**: Linux ARM64 runners are available for public repositories but not yet for private repositories. We'll enable this as soon as GitHub makes them available for private repos.

### Performance Benefits

With native runners, you get:

- **üöÄ Faster builds**: No emulation overhead
- **üí∞ Cost effective**: Free for public repositories  
- **üîã Energy efficient**: ARM64 uses 30-40% less power
- **üìä Better resources**: 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM for public repos
- **üéØ True native**: Real native performance, not emulated

## Artifacts

The action automatically uploads mutation reports as GitHub artifacts:

- `mutation-report.html` - Interactive HTML report
- `mutation-report.json` - Machine-readable JSON report  
- `mutation-report.md` - Markdown summary report

These artifacts are retained for 30 days and can be downloaded from the Actions tab.

## Permissions

Make sure your workflow has the necessary permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write  # If you want to comment on PRs
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Configuration file not found**
   - Ensure the `config-path` points to the correct location
   - Check that the file is committed to your repository

2. **Permission denied when downloading tree-mutator**
   - Verify that `GITHUB_TOKEN` has access to the private repository
   - For organization repositories, you may need a personal access token

3. **Binary not found in release**
   - Check that the release contains the expected binary assets
   - The action will list available assets if the expected binary is not found

4. **Tests failing during mutation testing**
   - Ensure your test command works in the CI environment
   - Check test timeouts and dependencies

5. **Low mutation score**
   - Review the HTML report to see which mutations survived
   - Add tests to cover the uncaught mutations

### Debug Mode

To enable debug logging, add this to your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Run Mutation Testing
  uses: obrasa/tree-mutator@v1
  env:
    ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    config-path: 'obrasa.yaml'
```

## Performance

This action is significantly faster than previous versions because:

- ‚ö° **No dependency installation**: Uses pre-built binaries
- üö´ **No Python/Poetry setup**: Eliminates environment setup time
- üì¶ **Smaller downloads**: Only downloads the binary, not entire source code
- üîÑ **Faster startup**: Binary execution is immediate

Typical performance improvements:
- **Setup time**: Reduced from ~2-3 minutes to ~10-30 seconds
- **Total runtime**: 60-80% faster for most projects

## Architecture

This action uses a clean, modular script-based architecture:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ action.yml              # Main action definition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ download-binary.sh   # Downloads the appropriate binary
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ run-mutator.sh       # Runs mutation testing and processes results
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### Scripts

- **`download-binary.sh`**: Handles platform detection and binary downloading with fallback mechanisms
- **`run-mutator.sh`**: Executes the mutation testing and extracts results for GitHub Actions outputs

This modular approach makes the action easier to:
- üîß **Maintain**: Each script has a single responsibility
- üêõ **Debug**: Issues can be isolated to specific components
- üß™ **Test**: Scripts can be tested independently
- üìñ **Understand**: Clean separation of concerns
